This repository hosts a versatile tool designed to streamline the loading of GPM (Global Precipitation Measurement) data into xarray datasets, facilitating seamless integration with Python's powerful data analysis ecosystem.

Key Features:

- Data Loading Tool:
    Our tool simplifies the process of loading GPM data into xarray datasets, enabling efficient data manipulation, visualization, and analysis.
- Plotting and Analysis:
    Leverage the xarray dataset to effortlessly create insightful plots and perform general analyses on GPM data.
- Microphysical Retrieval for DPR Measurements:
    We've developed a specialized microphysical retrieval module dedicated to DPR (Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar) measurements. This empowers users to derive valuable insights from DPR data.
- Example Notebook:
    Explore the 'test.ipynb' notebook to see a practical demonstration of how the microphysical retrieval can be seamlessly executed.
